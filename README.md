# Crash Data from Town of Cary, North Carolina

### 1. Introduction
Traffic accidents are causing a substantial amount of unnecessary deaths and injuries every year in the United States. Having a better understanding about the leading causes that contribute to vehicle crashes on road is a very important step towards reducing the occurrence of these unfortunate events. In this paper, we investigate the most common reasons that lead to traffic accidents in the Town of Cary (North Carolina) in particular, and then generalize our findings to the entire US country in general. Through our analysis, we effectively show the following interesting observations: 
(1) COVID-19 pandemic substantially reduced traffic congestion as well as vehicle crashes on road during 2020 compared to prior years.
(2) The most common reasons that have led to crashes is due to driversâ€™ carelessness and ignorance of their own vehicle conditions.
(3) Most traffic accidents occur in the afternoon during rush hour, and very few accidents occur at night but most of them are fatal. 
(4) Taxicab has the highest crash percentage during bad weather condition, which is possibly due to tax drivers are often in a rush.
(5) Vehicle crashes often happen in dark lighting condition on two-way roads without medians separating the two traveling sides.
